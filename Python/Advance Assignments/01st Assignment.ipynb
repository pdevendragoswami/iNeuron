    "    An inheritance search for an attribute follows a specific pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initially, Python looks for the attribute within the instance itself.\n",
    "    - If the attribute isn't found in the instance, Python proceeds to search within the class from which the instance was created.\n",
    "    - Next, Python searches in the superclass or superclasses, following the class hierarchy specified in the class header.\n",
    "    - If the attribute remains unfound after traversing through the superclass chain, Python finally looks into the built-in object class, which serves as the ultimate base class for all Python objects."

    "   Class Object:\n",
    "   - A class object is created when the class itself is defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instance Object:\n",
    "   - An instance object, also known as an instance, is created when the class is instantiated or when you create an object of the class.\n",
    "   - It represents a specific occurrence of the class and has its own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "   - Instance objects can access both class-level variables/methods and instance-specific data.\n",
