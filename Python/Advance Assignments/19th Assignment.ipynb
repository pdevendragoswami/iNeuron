    "    Encapsulation is process of binding the code and data into a single unit.Python supports encapsulation by allowing variables and methods to be hidden or restricted from direct access. This helps prevent accidental modification of data and encourages access through methods, promoting data integrity and security. Variables or methods starting with a single underscore (_) are considered protected, while those starting with double underscores (__) are treated as private."
