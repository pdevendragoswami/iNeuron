    "\n",
    "    When an exception is raised in Python, the interpreter looks for an exception handler to handle it. Class-based exceptions are matched to handlers based on their inheritance hierarchy. If an exception class is derived from another exception class, handlers for the base class will also handle exceptions of the derived class. This means that if an exception handler is defined for a base class, it will also handle exceptions of any derived classes."

By providing the exception type and a descriptive error message, the raise statement helps communicate the reason for the exception.\n",

However, if the condition evaluates to False, an AssertionError is raised with an optional error message. This allows programmers to specify the text of the error message associated with the failed assertion, providing clarity on the cause of the assertion failure.\n",
