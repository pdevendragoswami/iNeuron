    "    - It is required when different parts of the code require distinct functionalities from the same module.\n",

The __name__ attribute holds the name of the current module. When a script is executed directly, __name__ is set to __main__, allowing you to conditionally execute code based on whether the script is being run directly or imported as a module."
