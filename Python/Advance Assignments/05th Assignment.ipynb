    "\n",
    "    The concept of delegation in programming refers to the act of passing responsibility for a particular task or operation to another object or component. Instead of directly performing the task itself, an object delegates the responsibility to another object, typically one specialized in handling that task. Delegation allows for better code organization, separation of concerns, and code reuse."

    "Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Ans: Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios\n",
