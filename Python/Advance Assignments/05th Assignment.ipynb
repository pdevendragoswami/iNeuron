    "\n",
    "    The concept of delegation in programming refers to the act of passing responsibility for a particular task or operation to another object or component. Instead of directly performing the task itself, an object delegates the responsibility to another object, typically one specialized in handling that task. Delegation allows for better code organization, separation of concerns, and code reuse."

    "    Bound methods are those methods that are attributes of a class and accessed via an instance. It is also known as the instance method since it depends on the instance. In the bound method, the instance itself is automatically passed as the first argument(referred as self). We can simply access them through an instance of the class. Python automatically binds the instance to the method, enabling it to access and manipulate instance attributes."
