    "1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes occurring in an experiment.It describes how the random variable are distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "    While the individual outcomes may be random, the distribution itself provides information about the likelihood of those outcomes. For example, in a fair six-sided die roll, each outcome has an equal probability of 1/6. So, while we can't predict the exact outcome of a single roll, but we can predict the overall distribution of outcomes over many rolls."

    "\n",
    "    True random numbers are generated from physical processes, while pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms and thus are deterministic. The latter are considered \"good enough\" because they can exhibit a uniform distribution and are efficiently produced, making them suitable for various practical applications."

    " \n",
