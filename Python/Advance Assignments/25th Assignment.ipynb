    "Q1. What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Numpy Ndarray provides a lot of convenient and optimized methods for performing several mathematical operations on vectors.\n",

    "Pandas Dataframe is an in-memory 2-dimensional tabular representation of data. In simpler words, it can be seen as a spreadsheet having rows and columns.\n",

    "Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames are both data structures used in Python for handling and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure**:\n",
    "   - Numpy arrays are homogeneous collections of elements, all of the same data type.\n",
    "   - Pandas DataFrames are heterogeneous tabular data structures with labeled axes (rows and columns). Each column in a DataFrame can have a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functionality**:\n",
    "   - Numpy arrays provide support for mathematical operations and array-oriented computing.\n",
    "   - Pandas DataFrames offer more high-level data manipulation tools, such as indexing, merging, grouping, and time-series functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - Numpy arrays are indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.\n",
    "   - Pandas DataFrames can be indexed by row labels, column labels, or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Numpy arrays are more efficient for numerical operations and are suitable for mathematical computations.\n",
    "   - Pandas DataFrames are more flexible for data analysis tasks, especially when dealing with heterogeneous data and labeled axes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- To convert a Pandas DataFrame to a Numpy array, you can use the `.values` attribute of the DataFrame.\n",
