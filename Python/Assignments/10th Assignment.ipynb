    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copy()`: It is used to copy a file from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the path to the source file and the path to the destination file. \n",
    "If `dst` is a directory, the file is copied into that directory with the same base name. If `dst` is a file path, the file is copied and renamed to the specified destination path.If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copytree()`: It is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the path to the source directory and the path to the destination directory. If the destination directory already exists, it will raise an error.\n",

    "- Shutil:\n",
    "  -  Shutil module provides a function called as shutil.rmtree() which is used to recursively delete a directory tree, which means it deletes the specified directory and all its contents without moving them to the trash.\n",
    "  - This operation is irreversible and directly removes the files from the file system.\n",
